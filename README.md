# ML-Models

This repository consists of standard Machine Learning Algorithms<br>
It includes the use of standard libraries scikit_learn, pandas, tensorflow, quandl

* The Perceptron Model is implementation of a single neuron called Perceptron <br>
  It implements basic gates  that is OR, NOR, AND and NAND gates

* The Linear Regression works on the data of google stocks and using linear regression getting the best fit line <br>
  Then predicting the stock prices for next 30 days

* The K-Nearest algorithm works on data of breast cancer and classifies them into benign or malignant<br>
  One is using library and other one without using standard library
